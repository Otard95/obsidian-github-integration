# Wiki liknks

Wiki links seem to to be very simple. The syntax is `[[<The linked file's name excluding ext>]]` without the path. This is not default [[MD Links|markdown]] syntax and might not be supported by GitHub.

## Test result

The wiki links do not work on GitHub, so I'll need to find a was to convert them to standard markdown links.
