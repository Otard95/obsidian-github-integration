# MD Links

Markdown links are not quite as simple as [Wiki Links](<Wiki Links.md>), but they are far from complex, with the syntax `[<Link text>](<link relative path>)`.

## Quirc?

Now it seems Obsidian requires the link to be wrapped in `<` `>` when the link includes spaces. Which I'm not sure is Markdown standard, so I'll need to test that on GitHub.

No GitHub handles this just fine!

However Obsidian works a lot better with links that use `%20` for spaces rather than enclosing the link in `<>`.
