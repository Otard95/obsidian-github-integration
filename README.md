# Exploring how to best integrate Obsidian with GitHub

Here I wan't to test out how well Obsidian vaults behave in GitHub or what would be needed to make it behave.
I'll be testing things like liks, backlinks and more.

## TODO

> - [x] Test lInks
> 	- [x] How does [[Wiki Links]] behave on GitHub
> 	- [x] How does [MD liks](./MD%20Links.md) behave in Obsidian
> 	- [x] [[Moving and Renaming]] linked files
> 	- [x] [[Converting links]]
> - [x] [[Back links]]
