# Moving and Renaming linked files

I wan't links to update when moving or remaing files both for [[Wiki Links]] and [Markdown Links](MD%20Links.md Links.md>).

Here I'll setup some links to files that should not be linked anywhere else. To make testing easier.

## Wiki Links

[[Wiki Link Test 1]]

Works like a charm then renaming and moving(tho moving doesn't change anythin for Wiki Links)

## MD Links

[Link Test](Wiki%20Link%20Test%201.md)

Renaming Doesn't quite work with links in `<>` and it doesn't update the link when moving the target.
